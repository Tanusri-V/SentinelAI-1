# 🔐 SentinelAI  
**Behavior-Based Identity Theft Detection System**

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

SentinelAI is a web-based analytics platform that detects suspicious login behavior and identity theft using behavioral anomaly detection.  
It empowers organizations to identify high-risk login events before damage occurs by analyzing patterns in login metadata such as location, device, time, and frequency. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

This repository contains the frontend dashboard built in **React, TypeScript, and Vite** with visualizations, anomaly alerts, and risk scoring.

## 🧠 Detection Logic (Explained Simply)

Each login attempt is scored using weighted anomaly signals such as:

| Signal | Weight | Meaning |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Impossible Travel | 30 | Unphysical travel speed between logins |
| New Location | 26 | Country/city not seen before for the user |
| New Device | 24 | Device not previously seen |
| Frequency Anomaly | 22 | Login rate outside expected patterns |
| Failed Login | 18 | Unsuccessful attempt |
| Off-hours Activity | 15 | Login outside usual hours |

Thresholds:
- **Low Risk:** < 45  
- **Medium Risk:** 45–69  
- **High Risk:** ≥ 70 :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## 🧩 Required CSV Columns

Minimum:
- `timestamp`  
- `userId`

Optional but recommended:
- `location`
- `device`
- `loginStatus`
- `ipAddress`

Aliases supported:
- `user`, `username` → `userId`  
- `time`, `datetime` → `timestamp` :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
